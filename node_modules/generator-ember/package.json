Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n* `--coffee`\n\n  Enable support for CoffeeScript.\n\n* `--karma`\n\n  Enables support for karma test runner\n\n## Testing\nTesting your app is as simple as running `grunt test`. The generator ships with the\n[karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html) for running the tests. Integration\ntests are written with [ember-testing](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages/ember-testing)\nand preferably mocha. Karma is highly configurable and you can take a look at the varity of options\non [its website](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Command not found\n\nManifests as: `-bash: yo: command not found`\n\nYou need to make sure that npm is on your path.  Add the following to your .bash_profile (or .bashrc):\n\n`PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH`\n\n### templateName issues\n\nManifests as: `You specified the templateName ... but it did not exist.`\n\nYou probably added a view; restart the server.\n\n## Changelog\nSee the [changelog file](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember/blob/master/changelog.md)\n\n## TODO\n\n* Change tests to instantiate and test objects instead of grepping for text\n* DRY up/refactor tests\n* Consider ES6 as base structure\n* Remove Ruby dependency\n\n## Contribute\n\n### Basics\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nWhen submitting an issue, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md#issue-submission). Especially important is to make sure Yeoman is up-to-date, and providing the command or commands that cause the issue.\n\nWhen submitting a bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.\n\nWhen submitting a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.\n\n### Tips\n\nHere are some of the techniques I use; maybe they're useful for you.\n\nWhen developing...\n\n* in generator-ember dir, `npm link` to use what's in the local repo for `yo ember`\n* wipe the example webapp dir clean (`cd .. && rm -rf webapp`) from time-to-time to ensure the code output is coming from the latest generator (will re-install everything via npm, so be forewarned)\n* script/reset_dev_env.sh is there to help when you don't want to wipe and reinstall a test dir with Bower and Node modules again-and-again; read it and understand it before you use it. It's good\nif you want to smoke-test changes, bad if you update Bower and/or Node\nmods (ignores removing their subdirs.)\n\n## Background \n\n* Originally inspired by the [Ember Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/v1.0.0-rc.6.zip)\n* Taking influence from [ember_data_example](https://github.com/dgeb/ember_data_example)\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n",
