Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n* `--coffee`\n\n  Enable support for CoffeeScript.\n\n* `--karma`\n\n  Enables support for karma test runner\n\n## Testing\nTesting your app is as simple as running `grunt test`. The generator ships with the\n[karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html) for running the tests. Integration\ntests are written with [ember-testing](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages/ember-testing)\nand preferably mocha. Karma is highly configurable and you can take a look at the varity of options\non [its website](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Command not found\n\nManifests as: `-bash: yo: command not found`\n\nYou need to make sure that npm is on your path.  Add the following to your .bash_profile (or .bashrc):\n\n`PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH`\n\n### templateName issues\n\nManifests as: `You specified the templateName ... but it did not exist.`\n\nYou probably added a view; restart the server.\n\n## History\n\n### 0.6.0 (2013-08-10)\n\n* Substantial update for scaffolding\n* Assuming FixtureAdapter to start\n* Changed base model to DS.Model\n\n### 0.5.10 (2013-08-04)\n\n* Fixed issue where generator invoked in 'ember' dir\n* Fixed issue where routes in router.js were blasted on model subgen invocation\n* Reordered app script requires and added store.js\n\n### 0.5.9 (2013-07-25)\n\n* modified for [CVE-2013-4170](http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/07/25/ember-1-0-rc6-1-rc5-1-rc4-1-rc3-1-rc2-1-and-rc1-1-released.html)   \n\n### 0.5.8 (2013-07-25)\n\n* fixed karma-based app gen \n* simplication of install \n\n### 0.5.7 (2013-07-18)\n\n* abandon dependencies changes; not working\n\n### 0.5.6 (2013-07-18)\n\n* change dependencies for npm\n\n### 0.5.5 (2013-07-18)\n\n* more dependency-moving out of readme \n\n### 0.5.4 (2013-07-18)\n\n* moving dependencies out of readme \n\n### 0.5.3 (2013-07-17)\n\n* new look!\n* tests!\n\n### 0.5.2 (2013-07-15)\n\n* Fixed [#79](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember/issues/79) (srsly considering dropping CoffeeScript support for now)\n\n### 0.5.1 (2013-07-15)\n\n* Re-introduced @fayimora's testing improvement; now working with `grunt test`\n* documentation updates\n\n### 0.5.0 (2013-07-13)\n\n* Added basic scaffolding\n* By default, include Ember Data\n\n### 0.4.1 (2013-07-13)\n\n* Reverted changes for testing improvement\n\n### 0.4.0 (2013-07-11)\n\n* Added testing improvement\n* Upgraded to RC6\n* Upgraded to grunt-contrib-compass 0.3.0\n\n### 0.3.1 (2013-06-18)\n\n* Added install step to address [PhantomJS issue](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp/issues/92)\n\n### 0.3.0 (2013-06-16)\n\n* Upgraded to Ember 1.0 RC5\n* Support for scaffolding out CoffeeScript via `--coffee`\n* Support for jasmine as alternative test framework via `--test-framework`\n* Automatic script inclusions via [`grunt-neuter`](https://github.com/trek/grunt-neuter)\n* New prompt\n\n## TODO\n\n* Change tests to instantiate and test objects instead of grepping for text\n* DRY up/refactor tests\n* Consider ES6 as base structure\n* Remove Ruby dependency\n\n## Contribute\n\n### Basics\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nWhen submitting an issue, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md#issue-submission). Especially important is to make sure Yeoman is up-to-date, and providing the command or commands that cause the issue.\n\nWhen submitting a bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.\n\nWhen submitting a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.\n\n### Tips\n\nHere are some of the techniques I use; maybe they're useful for you.\n\nWhen developing...\n\n* in generator-ember dir, `npm link` to use what's in the local repo for `yo ember`\n* wipe the example webapp dir clean (`cd .. && rm -rf webapp`) from time-to-time to ensure the code output is coming from the latest generator (will re-install everything via npm, so be forewarned)\n* script/reset_dev_env.sh is there to help when you don't want to wipe and reinstall a test dir with Bower and Node modules again-and-again; read it and understand it before you use it. It's good\nif you want to smoke-test changes, bad if you update Bower and/or Node\nmods (ignores removing their subdirs.)\n\n## Background \n\n* Originally inspired by the [Ember Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/v1.0.0-rc.6.zip)\n* Taking influence from [ember_data_example](https://github.com/dgeb/ember_data_example)\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n",
